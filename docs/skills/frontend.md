1. Typography - Don't just use generic fonts. Pick something interesting.
2. Color & Theme - Commit to a cohesive color palette. Instead of using 10 colors, use 2-3 dominant colors with sharp accents.
3. Motion - Use animations strategically. Do not overload it with animations.
4. Spatial Composition - Break the grid. Use asymmetry. Overlap elements. Create unexpected layouts.
5. Backgrounds & Details - Don't just use solid colors. Add textures, subtle gradients, decorative elements that match your aesthetic.
6. Always have a look at the UX. Create the UI so it is easy to use and intuitive. A 10 year old child should be able to use it without any issues.
7. Make sure that the UI always supports multiple languages. All strings must be loaded from a translation file.
